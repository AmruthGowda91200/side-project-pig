Here is the explanation of the code 

# Import the random module for generating random numbers
import random

# Define a function to simulate rolling a dice
def roll():
    # Set the minimum and maximum values for the dice roll
    min_value = 1
    max_value = 6
    
    # Generate a random number between the minimum and maximum values
    roll = random.randint(min_value, max_value)
    
    # Return the rolled value
    return roll

# Initialize the value of the dice roll
value = roll()

# Main game loop
while True:
    # Ask the user for the number of players
    players = input("Enter the number of players (2 - 4): ")
    
    # Validate the input
    if players.isdigit():
        # Convert the input to an integer
        players = int(players)
        
        # Check if the number of players is within the allowed range
        if 2 <= players <= 4:
            # Break out of the loop if the input is valid
            break
        else:
            # Print an error message if the input is not within the allowed range
            print("Must be between 2-4 players")
    else:
        # Print an error message if the input is not a digit
        print("Invalid, try again")

# Set the target score
max_score = 50

# Initialize the player scores
player_scores = [0 for _ in range(players)]

# Main game loop
while max(player_scores) < max_score:
    # Loop through each player
    for player_idx in range(players):
        # Print a message announcing the player's turn
        print("\nPlayer number", player_idx + 1, "turn has just started")
        
        # Print the player's current score
        print("Your total score is", player_scores[player_idx], "\n")
        
        # Initialize the current score for the turn
        current_score = 0
        
        # Loop until the player chooses to hold
        while True:
            # Ask the player if they want to roll
            should_roll = input("Would you like to roll (y)? ")
            
            # Check if the player wants to roll
            if should_roll.lower() != "y":
                # Break out of the loop if the player chooses to hold
                break
            
            # Roll the dice
            value = roll()
            
            # Check if the player rolled a 1
            if value == 1:
                # Print a message indicating the player rolled a 1
                print("You have rolled a 1 Turn done!")
                
                # Reset the current score for the turn
                current_score = 0
                
                # Break out of the loop
                break
            else:
                # Add the rolled value to the current score for the turn
                current_score += value
                
                # Print a message indicating the rolled value
                print("You rolled a", value)
                
                # Print the current score for the turn
                print("Your score is:", current_score)
        
        # Add the current score for the turn to the player's total score
        player_scores[player_idx] += current_score
        
        # Print the player's updated total score
        print("Your total score is:", player_scores[player_idx])

# Determine the winner
max_score = max(player_scores)
winning_idx = player_scores.index(max_score)

# Print the winner's information
print("Player number", winning_idx + 1, "is the winner with a score of:", max_score)
```

This code is a simple implementation of the Pig dice game, which is a game of risk and reward. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The game starts by asking the user to enter the number of players (2 to 4).
   - The `player_scores` list is initialized with zeros, representing each player's initial score.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds the target score of 50 points.
   - Inside the main loop, each player takes turns.
   - For each player's turn:
     - The current player's turn is announced.
     - The player's current total score is displayed.
     - The player's current score for the turn is initialized to 0.

3. **Rolling the Dice**:
   - The player is prompted to roll the dice.
   - If the player rolls a 1, the current score for the turn is reset to 0, and the turn ends.
   - If the player rolls any other number, it is added to the current score for the turn.
   - The current score for the turn is displayed.

4. **Choosing to Hold or Roll Again**:
   - The player is asked if they want to roll again or hold.
   - If the player chooses to roll again, the process repeats.
   - If the player chooses to hold, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

5. **Winning the Game**:
   - Once the main loop ends (when a player reaches or exceeds the target score), the winner is determined by finding the maximum score in the `player_scores` list.
   - The winning player's number (index + 1) and their score are displayed.
